# Algorithms in Verse: Bubble Sort Sonnet

## Bubble Sort: A Sonnet

```
Compare adjacent elements in pairs,
If order's wrong, then swap them into place.
Through all the list this simple rule declares:
The largest bubbles up to find its space.

Again we start, but now one less to check,
The second largest finds its rightful home.
Each pass through makes the chaos less a wreck,
Until at last no elements must roam.

Though simple in its elegance and grace,
And easy for beginners to perceive,
In practice, it's too slow to win the race—
O(n²) we sadly must believe.

But beauty lies in simplicity's pure art,
The bubble sort still teaches at the start.
```

## The Challenge

Can you write Quicksort as a limerick? Or Binary Search as free verse?

## Why This Matters

Poetry forces us to find the essence of an algorithm. The constraint reveals understanding.
