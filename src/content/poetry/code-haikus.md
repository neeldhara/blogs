# Code Haikus: Programming in 5-7-5

The constraint of haiku forces clarity. Here are programming concepts distilled to their essence.

## On Recursion

```
Function calls itself
Smaller problems, same pattern  
Base case stops the loop
```

## On Debugging

```
Print statements bloom wild
Binary search through the code
Bug reveals itself
```

## On Optimization

```
O(n squared) crawls
Refactor to n log n
Time complexity
```

## On Git Merge Conflicts

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes, their changes clash
Resolution waits
```

## On Learning

```
Stack Overflow searched
Tutorial incomplete
Understanding dawns
```

## Your Turn

Write a haiku about your coding experience today. The constraint reveals truth.
