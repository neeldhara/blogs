# Distributed Computing: Recent Advances

The field of distributed computing has seen remarkable progress in recent years. This post surveys key results from PODC, DISC, and other major venues.

## Consensus Protocols

### Byzantine Agreement in Asynchronous Networks

A breakthrough result achieves optimal resilience with expected constant rounds. The protocol uses cryptographic techniques combined with novel committee selection.

## Distributed Graph Algorithms

### Minimum Spanning Tree in the CONGEST Model

New algorithms achieve near-optimal round complexity for MST construction. The approach uses sophisticated graph decomposition techniques.

## Local Algorithms

### The Power of Local Computation

Recent work characterizes which problems admit constant-time local algorithms. The classification provides a complete picture for bounded-degree graphs.

## Future Directions

The intersection of distributed computing with machine learning presents exciting opportunities for both fields.
