# Project Euler: My Favorite Problems from 700+

After solving 700+ Project Euler problems, these are the ones that changed how I think about mathematics and programming.

## Problem 96: Su Doku

Not just Sudoku solving - but solving 50 puzzles efficiently. The beauty is in combining constraint propagation with backtracking.

## Problem 208: Robot Walks

A counting problem that requires deep mathematical insight. The connection to complex numbers is unexpected and beautiful.

## Problem 613: Pythagorean Ant

Probability meets geometry in this elegant problem. The solution requires careful integration and surprising symmetry observations.

## The Meta-Lesson

Project Euler teaches you:
- Mathematical intuition matters more than coding speed
- There's always a clever approach
- The journey matters more than the destination

## Getting Started

Don't aim for the leaderboard. Aim for understanding. Each problem is a teacher.
