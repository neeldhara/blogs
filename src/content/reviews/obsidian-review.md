# Obsidian: A Year Later

After a year of daily use, Obsidian has transformed how I think about knowledge management.

## What Works Brilliantly

### The Graph View
Seeing connections between ideas visually has led to unexpected research insights. The graph isn't just pretty - it's functional.

### Plugin Ecosystem
The community plugins are incredible. Dataview turns your notes into a database. Templater automates repetitive tasks.

### Local Storage
Your notes are just markdown files. No vendor lock-in, complete control, and peace of mind.

## Pain Points

### Mobile Experience
While functional, the mobile app lacks the fluidity of the desktop version. Syncing can occasionally hiccup.

### Learning Curve
The flexibility means complexity. New users might feel overwhelmed by options.

## The Verdict

For academics and researchers, Obsidian is transformative. The investment in learning pays dividends in productivity and insight.
