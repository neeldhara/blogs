# ZSA Moonlander: Ergonomic Keyboard for Coders

After years of wrist pain, I took the plunge into ergonomic mechanical keyboards.

## The Learning Curve

Week 1: 20 WPM and questioning life choices
Week 2: 40 WPM and seeing the light
Month 2: Back to 80 WPM with no wrist pain

## The Good

- Columnar layout makes sense once muscle memory adapts
- Thumb clusters are game-changers for shortcuts
- The configurability is endless (perhaps too endless)

## The Investment

At $365, it's expensive. But compared to physical therapy or career-limiting injury? Bargain.

## Who Should Buy This?

If you type for a living and feel any discomfort, don't wait. Your future self will thank you.
