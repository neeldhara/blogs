# Algorithmic Sketches: Visualizing Data Structures

Sometimes the best way to understand an algorithm is to draw it.

## Today's Sketch: Red-Black Trees

![Red-Black Tree Rotation](sketch-placeholder)

The rotation operation finally clicked when I drew it step-by-step. Each node's journey through the rotation becomes a story.

## The Process

1. Start with pencil - mistakes are part of learning
2. Trace the algorithm's execution
3. Add color to highlight invariants
4. Annotate with key insights

## Why Drawing Helps

- Forces you to slow down and really see the structure
- Reveals patterns that code obscures
- Creates memorable mental models
- Makes teaching more engaging

## This Week's Challenge

Draw your own version of quicksort partitioning. Share it and let's learn from each other's visualizations.

## The Art in Computer Science

Algorithms are beautiful. Drawing them reminds us that computer science is as much art as it is science.
