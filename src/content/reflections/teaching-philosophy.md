# On Teaching Algorithms: Lessons from a Decade

Ten years of teaching has taught me more than any textbook could.

## Start with Why

Students don't care about O(n log n) until they understand why their code is slow. Real problems first, theory second.

## The Power of Visualization

Abstract concepts become concrete when visualized. Every algorithm should have a picture.

## Failure is a Feature

Let students struggle. The struggle is where learning happens. But know when to throw a lifeline.

## Assessment Philosophy

Test understanding, not memorization. Open-book exams with novel problems beat closed-book regurgitation every time.

## The Joy of "Aha!" Moments

There's no feeling quite like seeing a student's eyes light up when a concept clicks. That's why we do this.
