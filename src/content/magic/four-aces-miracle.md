# The Four Aces Miracle: A Self-Working Mathematical Marvel

This trick never fails to amaze students, and the mathematics behind it is even more amazing.

## The Effect

A spectator deals cards into four piles while making random choices. Impossibly, the four aces end up on top of each pile.

## The Secret

It's all about invariants and modular arithmetic. No sleight of hand required - pure mathematics does the magic.

## The Method

1. Pre-arrange the deck (the math determines the arrangement)
2. Have the spectator deal following simple rules
3. The aces appear automatically

## The Mathematics

The dealing process preserves certain positional invariants modulo 4. The initial arrangement ensures these invariants place the aces correctly.

## Teaching Applications

This trick demonstrates:
- Modular arithmetic
- Invariants in algorithms
- Deterministic vs. random processes

## The Bigger Lesson

Mathematics can create experiences that feel like magic. And that feeling of wonder? That's what hooks students on math.
