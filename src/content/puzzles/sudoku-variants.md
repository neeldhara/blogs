# Beyond Sudoku: Exploring Constraint Satisfaction Puzzles

Sudoku is just the beginning. Let's explore variants that push the boundaries of logic puzzles.

## Killer Sudoku

Combine Sudoku with Kakuro - cages show sums, but no digit repeats within a cage.

## Sandwich Sudoku

The numbers outside show the sum of digits between 1 and 9 in that row/column. Simple rule, complex implications!

## The Algorithm Connection

These puzzles are constraint satisfaction problems. Techniques like arc consistency and backtracking with constraint propagation solve them efficiently.

## Create Your Own

What happens if we add chess knight move constraints? The design space is infinite!
