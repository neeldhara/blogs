# The Knight's Tour: An Interactive Exploration

Can a knight visit every square on a chessboard exactly once? This ancient puzzle hides deep mathematical structure.

## The Basic Challenge

Start with a 5Ã—5 board. Can you find a knight's tour? What about one that returns to the starting square (a closed tour)?

## Mathematical Beauty

The problem connects to:
- Hamiltonian paths in graphs
- Warnsdorff's heuristic
- Magic squares (surprisingly!)

## The Algorithm

The key insight: always move to the square with fewest onward moves. This simple heuristic works remarkably well.

## Try It Yourself

[Interactive board would go here - imagine clicking squares to build your tour]

## Going Deeper

For which board sizes do closed tours exist? The answer involves beautiful number theory.
